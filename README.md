This is a basic chat client/server program I created simply to learn about multiplayer networking in the Godot Engine.

By no means is this program meant to be used for any actual purposes, so it is very barebones. You can set a user name, host a server, connect to servers, send messages, track a list of users, and track 50 recent messages.

If for some reason you want to use this program or its code as a base for another project, go ahead.
